# This configuration file defines an "Environment" in Feedback Pipeline.
# https://tiny.distro.builders
#
# Environments influence how a workload looks like when installed.
# That's achieved by including specific packages — like coreutils-single — that
# influence the result.
# Environments can also act as base images when monitoring container sizes.
