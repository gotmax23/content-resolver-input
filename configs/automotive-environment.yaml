  description: >
    The base environment definition for the Automotive project,
    providing the minimum in-vehicle package set, suitable to be
    extended by additional, experimental and development workloads.

  # The environment includes the shared package set for all automotive
  # workloads.  In essence, this is identical to the in-vehicle package
  # set which the in-vehicle workload inherits with no additions.
  # This is so that other workloads can easily extend the inteded
  # in-vehicle set without duplicating the base required minimum.  It
  # doesn't mean their reference images need to be ostree-based.
